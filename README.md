🚦 Traffic Flow Analysis, Signal Optimization & Accident Risk Prediction
📌 Overview

A practical traffic engineering + data science project that analyzes traffic patterns, optimizes signal timings, and predicts accident severity using EDA, classical formulas, and machine learning.

🔑 Key Highlights

Identified peak traffic hours & accident hotspots using EDA and visual analytics

Applied Webster’s Method for signal optimization → ~70% reduction in vehicle delay

Built Logistic Regression & Decision Tree models for accident severity prediction

Found key risk drivers: speed, time of day, traffic volume

Used a realistically simulated urban traffic dataset



🚥 Signal Optimization

Used Webster’s formula to compute optimal cycle length

Calculated green splits & delays

Reduced average delay from ~19 sec → ~6 sec per vehicle



🤖 Machine Learning

Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree

Features: Hour, Weekday, Speed, Total Traffic

Outcome: Accident severity classification + interpretable feature importance
