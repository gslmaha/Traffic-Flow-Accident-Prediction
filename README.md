# Traffic-Flow-Accident-Prediction
• Performed exploratory analytics using Python to detect congested zones, peak-time behavior, and hazard-prone areas. • Simulated and optimized traffic signal logic, achieving a projected 70% reduction in vehicle wait time. • Built ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict accident risk based on speed and time-based features.
