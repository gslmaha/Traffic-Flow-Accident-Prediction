Traffic Flow Analysis, Signal Optimization & Accident Risk Prediction

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing urban traffic patterns, optimizing traffic signal timings, and predicting accident severity using data-driven and traffic engineering approaches.
By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), classical traffic engineering formulas, and machine learning models, the project delivers actionable insights for practical traffic management and road safety improvement.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze traffic flow patterns and identify peak hours

Detect accident-prone locations and high-risk time periods

Optimize traffic signal timings to reduce vehicle delays

Predict accident severity using machine learning models

Provide practical insights for traffic management and safety planning


🚥 Traffic Signal Optimization

Applied Webster’s Method for optimal signal cycle length calculation

Computed green split allocation for traffic movements

Performed delay analysis before and after optimization

Achieved approximately 70% reduction in average vehicle delay

This demonstrates how traditional traffic engineering principles can significantly improve traffic efficiency.

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is simulated with realistic urban traffic assumptions, designed to closely reflect real-world conditions:

Hourly traffic counts with morning and evening peak hours

Vehicle composition dominated by cars and two-wheelers

Higher accident frequency during high-traffic periods

Speed and accident severity assigned based on typical urban traffic conditions

Time-of-day effects included (day vs night)

This simulated dataset enables meaningful analysis, signal optimization, and predictive modeling.
